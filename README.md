# ML100Days
## Natural language processing marathon

Hello there, this is my github repository where I push my assignment for the <b>natural langauge processin online bootcamp</b> hosted by Cupoy. Below is a table showing the topic of each task. The tasks were originally designed to be completed on a daily basis, but as a student, I have to say that keeping the homeworks done on a daily basis is beyond my capacity. So, I do this whenever I can (mostly during winter and summer vacations), and I also try to review the previously completed notebooks when not writing new assignments. 
### Part 1: Machine learning (homework_ML)
